# Project Lessons Learned

This is a simple HTML and CSS project.

We had automatic tests with Cypress and practiced HTML tags and CSS selectors/main rules.

You can check the instructions at the [instructions file](INSTRUCTIONS.md) and view the [deploy here](https://heyset.github.io/sd011-project-lessons-learned/)
